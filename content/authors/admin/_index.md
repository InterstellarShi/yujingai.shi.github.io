## About Me

I am an undergraduate student at Emory University, majoring in Psychology and Computer Science. My research interests lie at the intersection of neuroscience and computational methods, particularly in the areas of perception, attention, learning and memory, and motor control. My previous work has spanned systems neuroscience, where I analyzed behavioral and single-neuron recording data to study vocal learning in songbirds, and cognitive neuroscience, where I used fMRI and VR to explore navigation and employed eye-tracking to investigate attention. Currently, I am working on my honors thesis under the guidance of Dr. Samuel Sober and Dr. Daniel Dilks, employing computational methods to investigate the role of Area X (part of Basal Ganglia) in song variability in songbirds.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I am an avid percussionist. Interestingly, it was during a music rehearsal, when I became fascinated by the intricate coordination of sound and sight, that my passion for vision and perception research was ignited.
